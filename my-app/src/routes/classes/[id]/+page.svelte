						Hi all! See 2 documents attached to this announcement: PowerPoint presentation
						(information about the exam, what to bring, etc) and Room assignments. Each room has the
						range of last names starting from 1 last name and ending on some other last name. You
						have to figure out which interval you last name belongs. For example, Michael Smith will
						be taking the exam in room 303. If you would like to practice more, see the link below
